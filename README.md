# JSnake :snake:
Classic video game Snake written in C++

### Motivation
I'm currently an undergraduate student in Computer Science (started Sep 2016), I started this project when I first finished the class that teaches me how to code in OOP, specifically C++, back in my second year. With the continuous of my study, I found that I can actually do more things with the project, so I decided to keep adding new features & techniques to this project each time I finish some of my interesting degree courses. In some degree, the growth of this project reflect the process that I was growing as a Computer Science student (from a plain paper). I hope this project could become more "joyful" by the time I graduate, although none of my friends would play the game for 2+ minutes now :)

### Get Started
For now the code only support Linux systems, but I'm learning/working on cross-platform version.

#### Prerequisites
We need [``ncurses``](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/) library for our Text-based User Interface

Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```

CentOS:
```
sudo yum install ncurses-devel
```

#### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/hijackhi77/jsnake.git
cd jsnake
make
```

### How to play?
Start the program by
```
./bin/jsnake
```
Use arrow keys <kbd>&uparrow;</kbd>, <kbd>&leftarrow;</kbd>, <kbd>&downarrow;</kbd>, <kbd>&rightarrow;</kbd>, or <kbd>w</kbd>, <kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>s</kbd>, <kbd>d</kbd> to control the snake, and ... you know all the rest.

###  My Skill Tree
As I mentioned, I will keep adding new features & techniques to the project along I continue what I have study from school. So please do let me know if you found I misunderstood any knowledge or anywhere I can do better!
